# FAQ Crowdsourcing Platform — Product Requirements Document

## 1. Product Vision & Mission

**Vision**: Build a community-driven platform where users collaboratively create, answer, vote on, and curate high-quality FAQs across topics/domains.

**Mission**: Democratize knowledge by letting the crowd surface the most common questions and surface the best answers — eliminating outdated, incomplete, or irrelevant FAQ pages.

**Why Crowdsourcing?**
- Subject matter experts are distributed across the crowd
- Real users know the *real* frequently asked questions (not what companies *think* people ask)
- Community voting ensures the best answers rise to the top
- Scales across languages, domains, and regions

---

## 2. Problem Statement

Traditional FAQs suffer from:
- **Staleness** — rarely updated after initial creation
- **Bias** — written by internal teams, not actual users
- **Incompleteness** — miss edge-case questions real users have
- **Poor discoverability** — flat lists with no ranking or search intelligence

**This platform solves it by** letting the crowd continuously submit, answer, refine, and vote on FAQs in real time.
